# TreeHacks Mentorship System

## What is this?

This was TreeHacks' (slightly overambitious) SMS-based mentorship system. We put numbers on every table, and hackers could text in with their issue and table number. Any available mentor with matching expertise would then recieve a swanky picture-message map with the hacker's table highlighted. Cool stuff. This repo includes the code for the main SMS app (built on Parse and Twilio), in addition to our utilities that generated the numbered signs for each table.

## Hey, this code doesn't work!

You're absolutely right. This code is completely horrendous (cobbled together over a couple sleepless nights), and I wouldn't be surprised if it would take more than a few hours to get it actually running again. However, we had a bunch of people wondering how we did it, and why not open-source it (aside from embarassment)? Hit up `rpalefsk@stanford.edu` if you have any questions.

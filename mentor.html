<p>Hey TreeHacks Mentors!</p>

<p>I’m Raphael, Director of Mentorship. My <b>only job for the weekend</b> is making mentorship run smoothly. So, if you have any issues at all, please don’t hesitate to let me know! You can even call me — my personal cell is (831) 212-3900, and I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Let’s get down to the details. Mentorship works like this:</p>

<p>1) You’ll text our special mentor phone number with a passphrase, and then set up the tags you’re experienced with. These can be specific technologies — java, angular, etc — or broader topics like design, hardware, and biotech. You can even add your own tags! </p>

<p>2) Every couple of minutes, we’ll text you a support ticket from a hacker. You can claim that ticket by texting back <b>anything</b>. Find the hacker on the map, help make their day better, and close the ticket by responding with anything again. That’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>3) If you want to take a break at any time (you deserve one!), just text “<b>off</b>  ” to turn off the texts. Easy.</p>

<p>If you want a more in-depth tutorial, check out the Mentors tab at: http://mentor.treehacks.com</p>

<p>Ready to get started? Text your personal passphrase to our number.</p>

<p>The number: <b>(415) 763-6867</b></p>

<p>Your personal passphrase: <b>{passphrase}</b></p>

<p>As you probably know too well, there’s no such thing as bug-free software. So please bear with us if anything goes wrong, and please let me know!</p>

<p>Again, so excited to have you here, and we hope we can support you as well as you’ll support our hackers!</p>

<p>Best,</p>
